# Multi-Purpose Turing Machine Simulator

This project contains implementations of **7 distinct Turing Machines** designed to recognize languages and perform arithmetic operations on binary numbers. It serves as an educational tool to demonstrate the capabilities of Turing Machines in language recognition and computation.

## Implemented Turing Machines

1. **TM for** \( L = \{ a^n b^m a^{n+m} \mid n, m \geq 1 \} \)  
2. **Binary Addition** (e.g., `101 + 11`)  
3. **Binary Division** (e.g., `110 / 10`)  
4. **Binary Multiplication** (e.g., `101 * 11`)  
5. **Binary Subtraction** (e.g., `1011 - 11`)  
6. **TM for** \( L = 0 (1)^* 0 \)  
7. **TM for** \( L = 0^n 1^n 2^n \)  

## Project Description

Each Turing Machine is implemented following the standard computational model with clearly defined states, tape alphabets, and transition functions. The project demonstrates both language recognition for complex languages and arithmetic computations on binary inputs, showcasing the versatility of Turing Machines.

## Features

- Simulates language recognition for non-regular languages.
- Performs binary arithmetic operations using Turing Machines.
- Step-by-step execution trace for understanding the computation process.
- Modular design for each Turing Machine.

## How to Use

1. Select the desired Turing Machine from the 7 available.
2. Provide the input string or binary numbers according to the machine's purpose.
3. Run the simulation to observe the tape changes, state transitions, and final result.
4. Interpret the output as acceptance/rejection for languages or computed result for arithmetic operations.
